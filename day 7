## LOOPS :
# 1. while loop 
 ## use while in the places where we are not sure ,how many times we have to write it 
i =1
while i <=10:
    print (i)
    i +=1
## i = 1
#3while i >1:
  #  print(i)
  # will print  1. till infinity
   # if we wrote += ,line , then will write the no. till infinity.


## will print the elements seperately .

 ## we can't iterate on int , float and complex no.

 ## break in for

  ## for int we can use range here , as range will give the no. within it 
for i in range(10):
    print(i) ## will give from  0 to 9 
a = range (10)
print(a) ## range(0,10) is the output

## del deletes it from the memory :-

for i in range(5):

    i=100 # will print upto 4 only 
    del i ## no change 
   ##  print(i) , won't work as we already deleted i 
for i in range (5):
    print(i)
    i = 100
    print(i) ## will give 1 then 100 , and so on.

    ## pass
    ## it just creates a blank string
